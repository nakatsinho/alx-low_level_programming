- Working with recursive functions.

## 0x09-static_libraries
- Creating and using Static Libraries in C.

## 0x0A-argc_argv
- argc is Argument count.
- argv is Argument vector.
- passing argc and argv to main.

## 0x0B-malloc_free
- ``` malloc ``` function allocates a specific number of bytes in memory and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
- ``` free ``` function frees up memory allocated.
> This project entails some ways in whihc malloc and free can be used in C.

## 0x0C-more_malloc_free
> This project entails more ways in which malloc can be used.

## 0x0D-preprocessor
> Thr preprocessor removes comments and includes header files in source code before compilation begins. It also replaces macro names with code.
> This project will inlcude some of the ways in which macros are effective in C.

## 0x0E-structures_typedef
> Structures in C are user defined datatypes that can hold elements of different datatypes.
> Typedef is used to declare elements of a cetain datatype from an existing datatype. 
> - This project outlines the different uses of structures and typedef.

## 0x0F-function_pointers
> Like normal pointers, there exists pointers that point to code rather than data these are function pointers.
> - This project shows some of the ways we can use function pointers.

## 0x10-variadic_functions
> A variadic function is a function that takes a  variable number of arguments whenever its called.
> - This project outlines different ways in which variadic functions can be used.

## 0x12-singly_linked_lists
> A linked list is a naturally recursive data structure.
> - This project outlines some of the ways in which linked lists can be used.

## 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists
> - This project contains more ways of using linked lists.

## 0x14-bit_manipulation
> Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data
shorter than a byte. 
> - C language is very efficient in manpulating bits.
> - This project shows different ways of manipulating bits in C.

## 0x15-file_io
> Dealing with system calls provided by the kernel.

## 0x17-doubly_linked_lists

> Doubly linked list si different from the singly linked list such that each node has an extra pointer to the previous node.
- In this project, different operatiosn on the doubly linked list are demonstrated.


## 0x18-dynamic_libraries

> Unlike static libraries, dynamic libraries are not stored in the executable file.
> They can be utilised by many programs and there is no need to recompile whenever a change is done.
> This project shows how to create and use a dynamic library.

## 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

> A stack is a linear data stsructure in which elements can be inserted and deleted only from one side of the list (i.e *top*). It follows the *LIFO* (Last in First Out) principle.
> A queue is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted only from one side of the list called the *rear* and elements can be deleted only from the *front*. It follows the *FIFO* (First In First Out) principle. 
> These concepts were ijmplemented under the [monty](https://github.com/musangisilvia/monty) project.

## 0x1A. C - Hash tables

> A hash table (or hash map) is a data structure that implements an [associative array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) [abstract data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type), A structure that can map keys to values. 
> It uses a [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) to compute an *index* (or hash code) into an array of *buckets* or *slots* from which the desired value can be found.

## 0x1B Sorting Algorithm and Big-O notations

Sorting algorithms are step by step procedures that put elements in a list in a certain order. The most frequently used orders are [numerical order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_order) and [lexicographical order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order).

Sorting is important for optimaizing the efficiency of other algorithm is itself is efficient.In addition, it is usefule for [canonicalizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonicalization) data for producing human readable output.

Big-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm. This means it compares two similar algorithms and reduces the comparison to a single variable.


## 0x1C-makefiles

A makefile is a file that defines a set of tasks to be executed. It is a simple way to organize code compilation.

## 0x1E-search_algorithms
A search algorithm is an algorithm which solves a search problem. It works to retrieve information stored within some data structure or calculated in the search space ofa problem domain either
with discrete or continuous values
